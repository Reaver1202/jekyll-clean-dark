- [ - This is how trees could help solve the climate crisis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/trees-reforestation-climate-change-crisis?fbclid=IwAR23T4diusOI02YxcWeBFe1BevpwJiIVOAuzvKipji0Yx9HPk2gsyIm1ec4)
- Our map shows 3.04 billion trees on Earth – seven times more than previously estimated based purely on satellite imagery.
- More importantly, we now know that under current climate conditions the Earth could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree cover – 1.6 billion more than the currently existing 2.8 billion hectares. Of the current tree cover, 0.9 billion hectares are located outside of areas currently used for human development, such as urban and agriculture land. This means that there is currently an area of the size of the US available for tree restoration.

- What does this mean? Once mature, these new forests could store 205 billion tonnes of carbon: about two thirds of the 300 billion tonnes of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity since the Industrial Revolution.
